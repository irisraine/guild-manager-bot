# Image Thread Manager bot

## Description

This Discord bot is designed to automatically create a discussion thread in the current channel whenever a user posts 
an image. The bot will use the image as the initial message content for the thread and will include a welcome message 
to encourage users to start a discussion.

This bot does not have any commands, as it is designed to run automatically in the background.
